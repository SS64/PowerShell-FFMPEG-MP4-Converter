# PowerShell-FFMPEG-MP4-Converter
A PowerShell based script that utilizes FFmpeg to convert a video to MP4

## Usage
Download ffmpeg.exe and place it in the same directory as the script and run the script from PowerShell.

## Changes
This has been largely rewritten, to remove the quality option, add a resizing option and add support for long filenames with spaces. The number of compression choices is limited to just 5 for ease of use.

## Todo
Add an option to skip resizing altogether.

## Licence
Added a licence section which simply mirrors the licence requirements of FFmpeg
